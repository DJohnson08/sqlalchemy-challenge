This notebook conducts an analysis of climate data using SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database, extracting and processing information about precipitation, stations, and temperature observations from a climate dataset. Visualizations are also created to understand the trends in climate data.

Database Setup and Inspection:

A SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite) is connected using SQLAlchemy.
The tables Measurement and Station are reflected to explore their schema.


Precipitation Analysis:

Precipitation data for the last 12 months is queried, starting from a calculated date, one_year_ago.
A Pandas DataFrame is created to store the results, and the data is visualized as a line plot showing precipitation trends over the year.


Result:

The precipitation plot highlights periods of higher and lower rainfall within the year.


Station Analysis:

The total number of weather stations is queried from the database.
The stations are ranked by their observation activity, identifying the most active station, USC00519281.


Temperature Analysis:

Data for the most active station is further analyzed:
The minimum, maximum, and average temperature for the station are calculated.
A histogram of temperature observations over the last 12 months is plotted.



Result:

The histogram provides a distribution of temperature frequencies, showing the most commonly observed temperatures.

Session Closure:The SQLAlchemy session is closed to release resources after the analysis.

Visualizations: Precipitation Line Plot: Demonstrates seasonal precipitation patterns across the year.

Temperature Histogram: Highlights the spread of temperatures observed at the most active station (USC00519281).

Strengths: The notebook effectively connects to the database and queries data for insightful analysis.
The visualizations provide clear and concise representations of the trends.
